Repository for Personal Dataset Project for DATA115, Spring 2021
## Motivation
I have always watched football growing up and I have been very invested as of lately. When I was watching a game a while back, I heard an announcer bring up a point about how having more time to throw increases the chance of a completion. I took their word for it but I ever looked into any of the data behind it. My goal for this data set is to see how time to throw impacts pass completion in the 2020 NFL regular season. 
## Data Process
I collected my data from NFL Next Gen Stats (https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/stats/passing/2020/REG/all#yards)
I set the filters on the website to show individual quarterback passing stats for the 2020 regular season. I only collected data for each quarterbacks ‘time to throw’ and ‘pass competition’. (Data was taken from every quarterback from the 2020 season for an average time to throw and percent of completion for the entire season). I took these columns and imported them into excel. After doing this, I decided to create a histogram for each calum because I thought it would be a good thing to include. Then I placed both data columns into a scatter chart. I adjusted the axis on the chart to have a closer look at the data.

These figures were all produced from the data that I collected. I found it helpful to look at both the categories individually as well as together during my data processes. 
1) A histogram and shows average time that a quarterback takes to throw in the 2020 season.
2) A histogram on the average percent of completion of quarterbacks in the 2020 season.
3) A scatter plot that displays a quarterback's average time to throw compared to their average pass completion on the season.
## Analysis
After plotting the data on the scatter plot, I wanted to take it step further to gain a better understanding of the data. I used excel to create a linear regression. Once I plotted this, I noticed that the percent of pass completion started to decline as time continued to increase. This is the opposite of my prediction. Based on the NFL 2020 regular season, the more time that a quarterback takes to throw, their completion slightly decreases. This  is a reasonable conclusion, because most of the time that a quarterback takes a long time to throw, they are attempting a deep pass and these are highly contested by the defense.
